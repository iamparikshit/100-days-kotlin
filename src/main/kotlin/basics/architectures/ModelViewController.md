# Model View Controller

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. 
It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. 
This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance

Pros : 
1. SOC
2. Modularity -> Each component can be developed and tested separately
3. Flexibility -> Since the components are independent, changes to one component do not affect the others, allowing for easier updates and modifications.
4. Parallel Development: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously, speeding up the development process.
5. Code Re-usability

Cons : 
1. Increased complexity
2. Limited control over User interface

### When to use it :
In summary, you should consider using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern when building complex applications that require separation of concerns, code reusability, testability, and support for parallel development.
