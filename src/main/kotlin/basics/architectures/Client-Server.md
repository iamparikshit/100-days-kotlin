# Client-server Architecture

Client-server architecture is a type of distributed system that consists of clients and servers. 
Server is responsible for hosting, managing, and delivering services to clients. 
Clients are connected to the server and communicate with it over the internet using a computer network. 
So when a client needs a service, it sends a request to the server, which processes the request and sends a response back to the client.


### Client: 
Client is a software application that requests resources and services made available by servers. 
It runs on a user's local computer or a remote machine and connects to a server. For example, a web browser is a type of client that sends requests to web servers.

### Servers:
Server is a software program that receives and processes requests from clients.
It operates on a remote machine and can be accessed by a user's local computer or workstation. A client can use a server to share resources and distribute tasks. For example, a web server is a type of server that receives and processes requests from web clients (e.g., web browsers).
